---

## Overview
The **Movie-Recommender-System** project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences.

Key features:
- Content-based filtering for movie recommendations.
- Data preprocessing using Bag-of-Words (BoW).
- Web-based interface for user interaction.

## Model Performance

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Cosine Similarity Score**: Measures the closeness of movies based on textual descriptions.

### Model Training Details
- **Vectorization**: BoW (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine Similarity
- **Dataset**: TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset

---

## Motivation
Recommender systems help users discover movies based on their interests, improving their movie-watching experience.

This project showcases the application of NLP and machine learning for movie recommendation based on textual metadata.

---

## Technical Aspect
### Training Movie Recommendation Model:
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Movies dataset collected from TMDB (The Movie Database).

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning movie descriptions by removing special characters and stopwords.
   - Converting text to numerical representations using Bag-of-Words (BoW).

3. **Model Training**:
   - Computing similarity between movies using Cosine Similarity.

4. **Web Application**:
   - A Flask-based web app allows users to enter movie names and receive recommendations.
   - The app is deployed on Render for public access.
  
---

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10. Install the required packages and libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
To run the Flask web app locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Deployment on Render

To deploy the Flask web app on Render:
- Push your code to GitHub.
- Log in to Render and create a new web service.
- Connect the GitHub repository.
- Configure environment variables (if any).
- Deploy and access your app live.
